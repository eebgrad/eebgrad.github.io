## About Me
I am a make-believe graduate student in the [UConn EEB department](https://eeb.uconn.edu) interested in the evolution, systematics, and ecology of seed and seedless plants, vertebrate and invertebrate animals, fungi, protists, and prokaryotes. I am also interested in developing ecological, phylogenetic, anatomical, and physiological methods.
